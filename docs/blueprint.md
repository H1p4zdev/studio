## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A desaturated grayish-blue (#4A697A) evoking stability and professionalism without being overly corporate.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F4F8), almost white, to provide a clean and high-contrast backdrop appropriate for a light color scheme.
- Accent color: A muted teal (#6A8E8B), which is close to the primary on the color wheel but distinct enough to highlight interactive elements.
- Bold, sans-serif fonts for headlines; monospace fonts for code snippets. Aim for readability and brutalist aesthetic.
- Use outlined, minimalist icons. Icons should be geometric and fit the neo-brutalist design.
- Grid-based layout with generous spacing; avoid rounded corners and favor sharp edges to maintain the neo-brutalist style.
- Scroll-triggered animations using GSAP or Framer Motion to animate transitions, content reveals, and interactive elements.
